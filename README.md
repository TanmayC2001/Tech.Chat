To Set Up The Project In The Linux machine
We need to install some packages of node
1- PeerJS  cmd = npm i peer
2- Nodemon  cmd = npm i nodemon
3- ejs  cmd = npm i ejs
4- express  cmd = npm i express
5- uuid  cmd npm i uuid
After successful installation of all these packages we have to run the project by using the command = npm run devStart
Then we have to start the peer by using command = peerjs --port 3001

Now we can run our project with the help of our localhost
url = localhost:3000
